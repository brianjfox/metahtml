<synopsis mdb [filename...]>

<code>mdb</code> is a source-level interactive debugger for
<meta-html>.  There currently is no comprehensive documentation for
the debugger.  However, the following instructions may be of help to
you:

<ul>
  <li> You may type <meta-html> expressions directly at the debugger
  prompt.  Any expression beginning with the <b>&lt</b> character is
  assumed to be a <meta-html> expression, and is immediately
  evaluated, and the output printed.

  <li> You may place debugger commands in an <code>.mdbinit</code>
  file.  Commands found therein will be executed by <code>mdb</code>
  upon startup.

  <li> Mentioning <var filename>s on the invocation line is equivalent
  to typing <code>load <var filename></code> from within
  <code>mdb</code>.

  <li> Full completion over <meta-html> symbols is supported.  Press
  <code>TAB</code> to complete the symbol that you are typing, press
  it again to see all of the possible completions that are available.

  <li> Type <code>help</code> at the <code>mdb</code> prompt to see
  what commands are available.
</ul>

MDB is an extremely useful tool for understanding what a particular
expression will produce, and for understanding how <meta-html> works.
<b>

Caveat:</b> The <code>breakpoint</code> facility needs work, but still
works well enough to be useful.
