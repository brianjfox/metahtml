<h3> Manually Remove Sessions </h3>
<ptext>
<synopsis delete-session [-f session-db] session-id ...>

<code>delete-session</code> can be used to manually remove a session
from the session database.  Since the session database is usually
owned by the superuser, you should run this command as the superuser
for it to have an effect.

If you are utilizing a session database which is not stored in the
usual location (<code>/tmp/sessions.db</code>), you may give the
<code>-f <i>FILENAME</i></code> argument, where
<code><i>FILENAME</i></code> is the path to the file containing the
session database.

Deletion of a session happens automatically after the session has
timed out, but at times (such as when debugging your new <meta-html>
application) you may wish to manually delete a single or many session
records.

Here is an example:

<include session.delete>
