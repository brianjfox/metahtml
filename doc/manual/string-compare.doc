There is a function in Meta-HTML called <string-compare x y> which
returns a value of "greater", "equal", or "less" if X is greater than,
equal to, or less than Y.

This function is undocumented because I haven't lived with it long
enough to see if it is useful, or if it requires additional arguments
to be useful.  The function is written entirely in C, so it is fast,
but it could have been defined in Meta-HTML by using the <sort> function:

    <defun string-compare-1 x[0] x[1] caseless?>
      <if <string-eq <get-var x[0]> <get-var x[1]>
		     caseless=<get-var caseless?>>
	  equal
	<concat
	  <set-var array[]=<get-var x[]>>
	  <sort x caseless=<get-var caseless?>>
	  <if <string-eq <get-var x[0]> <get-var array[0]>
			 caseless=<get-var caseless?>>
	      less
	    greater>>>
    </defun>

Examples:

	<string-compare "foo" "bar"> --> greater
	<string-compare "bar" "foo"> --> less
	<string-compare "foo" "FOO"> --> greater
	<string-compare "foo" "foo"> --> equal
	<string-compare "foo" "FOO" caseless=true> --> equal
