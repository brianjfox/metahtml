Write your function definitions with ;;; comments as the first part of the
function.  Meta-HTML now is capable of storing the first non-code part
of the function as documentation strings in the running binary.

The functions <%%function-documentation fun> and
<%%function-arguments fun> can be used to extract the documentation
and arguments respectively.

There is no mechanism for storing the documentation strings
permanently in the binary, or in the library files, as this would make
Meta-HTML too big (in the former case) and the library files
incompatible between earlier versions and new versions (in the latter
case).

I have documented the public functions in tagsets/* and
powerstrip-tags/* for the latest documentation -- there is a switch
that you can turn on in the bootstrap.mhtml file that causes a texinfo
formatted file of functions and documentation to be dumped out and
copied to the ../docs/manual directory.

Here is an example of a documented function:

<defun foo bar baz &rest args[]>
  ;;; Frob the BAR with BAZ optionally appending
  ;;; ARGS.
  ;;;
  ;;; Example:
  ;;;   <foo "this" <get-var that> and some "more args" here.
  ;;;   --> this-frobbed that-frobbed-and-some-more args-here
</defun>
