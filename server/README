			   Meta-HTML Server
	 Copyright 1995, 1998 Brian J. Fox (bfox@ai.mit.edu)

This directory contains the Meta-HTML server daemon, called Mhttpd.

To install the server by itself, use "./INSTALL".

To install the entire suite of Meta-HTML utilities and goodies, use
the script located one directory level about this one, called
"Install".

When you use either script, you are prompted for the values we need to
know in order to successfully install a web server -- it is easy and
painless to abort the installation at any time, right up until the
final confirmation.
