    Welcome to our simple SQL Rolodex application. This application serves
    as an example of building an SQL-based <Meta-HTML> Web Application.

    Most of the database work takes place in
    <concat
     <code>
     <thisdir>/
     <a href="view-source.mhtml?tagsets/rolodex.mhtml">
     tagsets/rolodex.mhtml
     </a>
     </code>>;
    this directory also contains the
    <a href="view-source.mhtml?tagsets/rolodex.api">dynamically built API</a>
    for the code, and the directory itself is a good place to start to
    understand the structure of a typical <Meta-HTML> application.

    ;;; Show our search form.

    There are only a few pages in the entire application -- you can click
    on the links below to view the <Meta-HTML> source of the referenced page.

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="view-source.mhtml?welcome.mhtml"><b>This Page</b></a><br>
      This welcome document to the application explains a little bit about
      how it works, and displays a small search form.

      <li> <a href="view-source.mhtml?rolodex-initialize.mhtml">
	<b>rolodex-initialize.mhtml</b>
      </a><br>
      This document allows privileged users to initialize the database.
      You can find the password that you need in
      <code>config/site.params</code>, which can only be viewed by those
      people with physical access to the site.

      <li> <a href="view-source.mhtml?rolodex-entry.mhtml">
	<b>rolodex-entry.mhtml</b>
	</a><br>
      This page is where an entry can be created, deleted, or modified.
      It is the target of the result of using the search form below.

      <li> <a href="view-source.mhtml?rolodex-browse.mhtml">
	<b>rolodex-browse.mhtml</b>
	</a><br>
      A relatively sophisticated interface for browsing a large number of
      entries from an SQL database.  The workhorse for this page is in
      <a href="view-source.mhtml?tagsets/browser.mhtml">
	tagsets/browser.mhtml
      </a>
    </ul>
  </plain-text>
