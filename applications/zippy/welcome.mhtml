    Are you tired of the same old content at those same old web sites?
    The <b><Meta-HTML> Active Filter</b> freshens up any Web page!

    Simply type the URL of your favorite web site into the box below, and
    click on the Zippy quote. This works well with corporate sites such as
    a <a href="<zippy http://www.ibm.com/lvg/annual96.html>">
    speech from IBM's CEO</a>, <zref www.eds.com>, or government sites
    such as <zref www.house.gov>.
    Once you have fetched a page, try following some of the links on
    it, and they will be, uh, fixed, too.

What is the meaning of all these stupid quotes thrown in the middle of
everything?

I do not find this amusing and may not visit this site again! If I
want to read stupid jokes, I'll read my own comic books. I came here
to read about dodge trucks, not meaningless and dumb commentary
remarks!

Grow up!!!

I've been using your active filter while perusing various religious
web sites and the experience has been... surreal.

Absolutely mind-boggling when a Zippy quote comes up in the middle of
a right-wing tirade. You just never know when it is real or Zippy -
especially the one about the nuns and teen appeal.

Your Zippy filter is the first thing on the web that ever made me wet
my pants!  It did wonders to my company's web page.  Remember:

Subject: Help!

Do you have any idea what this form is (see bottom of message)? It
appears whenever I try to download some software from a sharware site
- such as from 'http://web-proto.ua.com19730/cgi-bin/sfx/http://cwsapps.texas.net/image.html'

What URL is it looking for? Is this form really necessary? I suspect
that one of the kids pushed some button causing this form to be
activated because it just started appearing a couple of days ago. They
don't have a clue as to what they might have done and neither do I.

Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!

Hi,

Except for the (graphic) phallic symbol and the cool picture, what's 
does "Which mushroom will he use to end his story?" all about?
Sorry, I am really puzzled!

Thanks guys!  If I can't see pictures of naked women, discuss
abortion, or anything else that the pinheads in Washington decide may
not fit into their propanda machine, at the very least the true and
original Pinhead "Zippy" will spice up the resultant banalities
guaranteed under the Telecom Bill.

This filter is really funny.  Does it damage the original file in any
way.

What's with all the stupid quotes embedded in everything I'm trying
to read online?  I don't like them, and I don't appreciate their 
presence.  Either move them to the beginning and end of the 
documents or get rid of them!

Much obliged.

I on't quite know what's going on here, but i'm Amy-Cecilia, and if
you're the person who's been messing wiht my homepage, I'd sincerely
appreciate it if you'd stop.  It's nice to know you bothered to think
of "improvements" , but since it is my page, I'd like it if you stayed
off.

Thank you.

Where do the assinine comments come from? They interrupt my 
reading, and are not funny, if that's what they are supposed to be.

Just to let you know, being on-line is not worth it with all the s--- 
interjected into the valuable information.

Comment: Someone that stores files on your server has stolen my entire
web site and altered the pages with what they must think are funny
jokes and put them up on your server.  I do not appreciate this! Just
like you I'm trying to do business on the Internet and this kind of
stuff really is uncalled for. Here is the URL of the page:
http://www.ua.com/cgi-bin/sfx/www.west.net/~regent Their e-mail
address is hqm@ua.com I'm sure if they are clever enough to do stuff
like this that they can design their own page!  I would appreciate it
if you would remove these pages from your server and ask whoever did
it to stop mucking about with other people's pages. I have also
e-mailed the person and have asked them to remove the pages.

This is almost certainly the finest thing

how to apply this filter to the rest of the
universe, don't tell me about it. Just do it.
