Instructions for normal people:

    I) WHAT YOU NEED:

	1) THE SOURCE CODE TO THE META-HTML DISTRIBUTION.

	This file looks like `metahtml-M.mm.tar.gz', where "M" is the
	major release number, and "mm" is the minor release number.  The
	"tar.gz" part means that this is a gzipped Unix tape archive
	file -- it unpacks into a directory called `metahtml-M.mm' when
	you issue the command:

		gzip -d < metahtml-M.mm.tar.gz | tar -xf -


	2) AN INSTALLED VERSION OF GCC, 2.0 OR GREATER.
	
	It is conceivable that you can compile the sources without GCC,
	but not only will it require some modifications to `Makefile.in',
	but is somewhat undesirable as well, since GCC produces
	excellent code.


	3) A COMPILED VERSION OF GDBM, THE GNU DBM SYSTEM.

	If you are using a free version of Unix, such as the Hurd,
	Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and so on, chances are that you already
	have this library installed on your system.  Otherwise, you will
	have to get a distribution and compile it.  The canonical
	location of the distribution is at prep.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu.
	Try

		ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gdbm-1.7.3.tar.gz

	If you collect the source, (because you don't already have
	copies of `libgdbm.a' and `gdbm.h') yet you don't wish to
	install the library or headers, then simply place the
	distribution "next to" the Meta-HTML distribution.  For example,
	if you have placed the Meta-HTML source in "~/src/metahtml-5.09/",
	then you would place the GDBM source in "~src/gdbm-1.7.4/".
	Read the `INSTALL' file that came with the GDBM distribution to
	see how to compile it, and compile it first.


	4) If you would like to use the additional MSQL database
	   interface, you will need a copy of MSQL as well.  There are
	   many places on the net that you can obtain a distribution
	   from -- the author's release is at ftp://ftp.bond.edu.au, and
	   you can obtain a recent release from us, at

		ftp://ftp.metahtml.com/pub/helpers/msql-1.0.14.tar.gz


	5) If you would like to use the additional triple-DES encryption
	   enhancement with your version of Meta-HTML, you will need to
	   obtain Eric Young's DES library.  If you are located within
	   the domain of the United States, you may FTP a version of this
	   library from us, at:

		ftp://ftp.metahtml.com/pub/helpers/libdes.tar.gz


	4) If you would like to use the additional mySQL database
	   interface, you will need a copy of mySQL as well.  
	   The author's release is at ftp://ftp.tcx.se, and
	   you can obtain a recent release from us, at

		ftp://ftp.metahtml.com/pub/helpers/mysql-V.vv.tgz

    II) CONFIGURING THE RELEASE:

	RUN `./configure', PERHAPS WITH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS.

	The very first thing to do is to configure the source to compile
	on your particular platform.  If you have a relatively popular
	Unix box, you can expect Meta-HTML to compile cleanly and
	smoothly on it.

	If you are not using any special options, simply type

		./configure

	You may wish to give your version of Meta-HTML the ability to
	use additional enhancements, such as the MSQL database, or
	triple-DES encryption.  In order to do so, make sure that you
	have the related package already, and then run `./configure'.

	If you have installed a component in an unusual place, such as
	/main/db/mysql/*, then you can tell the Meta-HTML configure
	command where the needed library is:

	   ./configure --with-msqllib=/main/db/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.so

    III) COMPILE THE SOFTWARE:

	Type "make".


    IV)  INSTALL THE SOFTWARE:

	Type "make install".

	By default, "make install" will install the server, CGI engine,
	standalone processor (mhc), the debugger, and a host of useful
	utility programs in `/www/bin', and dynamic modules in `/www/lib'.
	We have found this to be very convenient.  If you would like to
	install Meta-HTML into a different directory, you have to tell
	the Makefile where that different directory is.  You do this by
	passing "bindir=/my/path" to the `make install' command:

		make install bindir=/usr/local/meta-html

    V)   INSTALL THE META-HTML DOCUMENTATION AND TUTORIALS

	Type "./install-site", and follow the instructions.

	This will install all of the Meta-HTML documentation and
	release notes under the	directory that you specify, and
	can configure and install the Meta-HTML Server or CGI Engine.
