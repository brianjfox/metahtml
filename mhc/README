This directory contains the Meta-HTML Stand-Alone Processor.

Installing the Meta-HTML Stand-Alone Processor:
----------------------------------------------

    Copy the file `mhc' to some directory in your path, say
    `/usr/local/bin'.

    Then, simply specify to your server that documents ending in ".mhtml"
    are executable, make sure that the Meta-HTML documents that you create
    actually are executable (chmod a+x file.mhtml), and that they begin
    with:

	#!/usr/local/bin/mhc
	<set-var mhtml::include-prefix=YOUR-DOCUMENT-ROOT>

    where "YOUR-DOCUMENT-ROOT" is replaced with the full path to your
    document directory (e.g., /usr/www/docs).
