<synopsis dbcreate --description DESCFILE FILE1 ... FILEN>

<code>dbcreate</code> takes a <i>description file</i> and files
representing database data, and creates a <meta-html>
<code>.packed</code> database file.  The output file can be converted
to a machine dependent form using <a href="dbpack.mhtml">
<code>dbpack</code></a>.

The contents of <var FILE1> and friends is as follows:

<ol>
  <li> Each line contains the field data for one record.
  <li> Field values are delimited by <b>FieldSep</b> characters
  (<i>defaults to the comma character</i>).
  <li> Field values may be surrounded by double-quote characters, in
  order to enter <b>FieldSep</b> characters in a particular field.
</ol>

The contents of <var DESCFILE> is as follows:

<ol>
  <li> Blank lines, and lines beginning with a pound-sign (`#')
  character are ignored.
  <li> Each line contains a directive, and some arguments to pass to
  that directive.
</ol>

Currently, the following directives are supported:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Database:</b> Names the output file (the
  <code>.packed</code> file) that <code>dbcreate</code> will write.

  <li> <b>Template:</b> Specifies, in order, the names of the fields
  which appear within the input data files.  The names of the fields
  are separated with commas.  This directive may appear more than
  once; this simply has the effect of concatenating all of the
  <b>Template</b> lines into one big template.

  <li> <b>KeyField:</b> Specifies the names of the fields which should
  be concatenated together to make a key for each record.  For
  example, you might use:
  <example>
    KeyField: LastName, FirstName
  </example>

  <li> <b>KeyUnique:</b> Specifies that the moment of creation and the
  number of the current record should be appended to each
  <b>KeyField</b>.  This guarantees that each generated key will be
  unique.

  <li> <b>AddField:</b> Specifies a static field that should be added
  to every record in the database.  For example, if the input file was
  a mailing list for Southern California, and yet that information did
  not appear in the field data for each field, one might place the
  following directive in the <var DESCFILE>:
  <example>
    AddField: Region, "Southern California"
  </example>

  This directive may appear as many times as needed.

  <li> <b>FieldSep:</b> Specifies the character which is used to separate
  the fields of each record in the input file.  This character
  defaults to a comma (`,').
</ul>

Here is a sample file of input:
</ptext>
<pre>
<include sample.data>

</pre>
<ptext>
And here is a description file for that input:
</ptext>
<pre>
<include sample.desc>

</pre>
