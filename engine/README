Installing the Meta-HTML CGI Engine:
------------------------------------

    Installing the Meta-HTML CGI Engine is a relatively simple task for
    any specific existing Web server, but the methods vary from server to
    server.  Thus, we suggest that you use your browser to connect to our
    on-line documentation discussing the specifics of server
    configuration:

	    http://www.metahtml.com/documentation/manual/install.mhtml

    That document is likely to be the most up-to-date one.  However, here
    are the instructions for installing the Engine under Apache:

  There are three possibilities to choose from when configuring your
  Apache server to work with Meta-HTML files:

	1) You can run every document on your server through the
	   Meta-HTML CGI Engine.  While there is nothing horribly
	   wrong with this, it is essentially equivalent to running
	   the Meta-HTML server itself, so we do not highly recommend it.

	2) You can run only Meta-HTML documents through the Meta-HTML
	   CGI Engine, foregoing the ability to use statefull sessions
	   with non-cookie capable browsers.  If you never use
	   statefull sessions, or, if you only have cookie-capable
	   clients connecting to your server (e.g., Netscape, MSIE),
	   this solution is completely reasonable, and totally painless.

	3) You can run only Meta-HTML documents through the Meta-HTML
	   CGI Engine, handling the case of non-cookie capable
	   browsers co-existing with statefull sessions.  This is our
	   recommended configuration.

  Step 1: Install the Engine:

    In order for the Engine to operate under Apache, you must place it
    in your <code>cgi-bin</code> directory, and make it executable.  For
    example, if your `srm.conf' file contained:

	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /www/htdocs/cgi-bin/

    then you would copy the Engine and its config file to that directory:

	user@host$ cp engine/engine /www/htdocs/cgi-bin/nph-engine
	user@host$ cp engine/engine.conf /www/htdocs/cgi-bin/


  Step 2: Edit the `engine.conf' file:

    Now edit the engine.conf file in `/www/htdocs/cgi-bin/', simply by
    reading the comments. For most installations, you won't actually
    need to change any of the parameters defined within -- the saavy
    site administrator may wish to add special behaviour, or to modify
    the existing behaviour.


  Step 3: Edit the Apache ``srm.conf' file:

    Now edit the srm.conf for your Apache server.
    There are two possible edits:

    1) Running Every Document Through the Engine

      Add the following line before all of your other "ScriptAlias" lines:

	ScriptAlias / /cgi-bin/nph-engine


    2) Running Only Meta-HTML Documents Through the Engine

      Add the following lines to the `srm.conf' file, before all other
     "ScriptAlias" lines:

	AddType metahtml/interpreted .mhtml
	Action metahtml/interpreted /cgi-bin/nph-engine


  Step 4: Compiling Apache 1.x With the Meta-HTML "mini-module":

    If you want to make sure that non-cookie capable browsers can have
    statefull sessions, you will need to recompile your 1.x server
    with the Meta-HTML mini-module installed.  Here is how to do that:

      Place the following line in "src/Configuration" (in your Apache
      1.x source tree)

	Module mhtml_module           mod_mhtml.o

      Copy the "mod_mhtml.c" file to the "src" directory of your Apache
      1.x source tree.

      Reconfigure the compilation of your server by typing:

	./Configure

      from the "src" directory of your Apache 1.x source tree.

      Recompile the Apache server by typing `make', and then copy the
      `httpd' file to whereever you have installed the previous version
      of the Apache server.

    That's it!
