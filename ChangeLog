	"p" be an alias for "print".

	* libserver/globals.c (mhtml_get_sid): Carefully get all cookies

	being used is a C++ compiler.  This allows us to link with
	randomly large libraries of C++ code, and to load them as modules.

	* configure.in (OS_LIBS): Check for frexp in -lm.

Sat Oct 12 00:09:17 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	* libserver/http.c (mhttpd_set_mhtml_variables): Two new variables
	MHTML::PHYSICAL-PATH and MHTML::PHYSICAL-DIRECTORY now contain the
	absolute path to the current document and containing directory.

	if the directory containing the document is not directly under the
	document root.
	(mhtml_read_content_from_fd): Set MHTML::BYTES-PER-SEC to our
	computed transfer rate.  This is really only useful for the

	and mhtml::permanent-cookie is set, then give the cookie a timeout
	value of Dec 29th, 1999.

Wed Oct  2 02:36:47 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	* Makefile.in (codedist): Make a distribution of the code and
	reference manual only, leaving out the applications and the
	release directory.

	* libserver/http.c (mhttpd_metahtml_engine): Added
	mhtml::per-page-function which is similar to
	mhtml::prologue-document, but requires less overhead.
	Set the default in mhttpd.conf and engine.conf to make the posted
	package innocuous.

	* engine/engine.conf: (mhtml::per-page-function) Add default to
	make posted data innocuous.

	to the same thing as MHTML::INCLUDE-PREFIX.
	(engine_make_request): Handle METAHTML_URL_COOKIE from servers with
	modifications that provide that.  Ugh.

Fri Sep 27 12:00:52 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	* engine/engine.c (parse_program_args): Only error when given args
	if there is no PATH_INFO variable in the environment.

	herself.

Thu Sep 12 10:35:59 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	* Makefile.in (PACKVER): 4.8: Added applications and tagsets to

	mhtml::exec-prefix.

	* libserver/http.c (mhttpd_execute_cgi): Handle "nph" CGIs.

Sun Jul 28 03:30:26 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	share the same core library code.

Sun Jul 21 11:12:41 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	* Makefile.in (PACKVER): 3.95: New primitive functions implement
	the reading and writing of raw package data.  You can get at the
	contents of the package containing user-defined functions with the
	package named *USER-FUNCTIONS*.

	The Engine is now closely and tightly linked with the server.  The
	old Engine is going to disappear by the next version.  Obviously,
	the ability to load raw package data greatly speeds up the
	operation of the Engine and the Server, or any Meta-HTML
	applications.  We can now have pre-compiled libraries of Meta-HTML
	code.
	
Sat Jul 20 17:38:05 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	Big Deal.
	
	* Makefile.in (PACKVER): 3.81: Bug fix release.  Better support
	for Windows NT.

Sat Jun 15 09:57:40 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	* Makefile.in (PACKVER): 3.79: Added CHUNK-SIZE argument to
	stream-get-contents.  We do downloading differently now.
	Use select on systems which have it in <stream_writeable>.
	<stream-shutdown> closes a socket stream.  Useful in conjunction
	with *standard-input*.

	* Makefile.in (PACKVER): 3.76: 
	* pagefuncs.c (pf_cgi_encode): Make sure that symbol names passed
	in a package get the package name as part of the symbol.  Without
	this, several existing packages will break.


Tue Jun 11 02:24:34 1996  Brian J. Fox  <bfox@nirvana.datawave.net>

	* Makefile.in (PACKVER): 3.75. Ports to Windows NT and HPUX 9.0.

	* pagefuncs.c, session.c, session.h, http.c: Change all references
	to `sid_t' to be `session_id_t'.  HPUX already has sid_t.

	* Moved logic for file locking into defines LOCKFILE and UNLOCKFILE.
	Affects files in libmhtml: session.c pagefuncs.c dbfuncs.c
	streamfuncs.c.

	Major change in server -- it no longer uses a FILE * for anything,
	just the original file descriptor that it was given.
	page_process_page can now do limited syntax checking.
	mdb uses this feature to read multi-line statements.

	Parsing changed to allow readable constructs.  You no longer have
	to quote your ass off when typing arguments to function calls.
	Array references can now simply be the name of a variable, and
	that variable is looked up to get the array reference value.

	This means that:

	   <set-var \"<get-var names[<get-var index>]>\"> = .... >

	is now written as:

	   <set-var <get-var names[index]> = ... >

	and "if" statements are usable again:

	   <if <get-var <get-var names[i]>>
	       <set-var foo[i] = "<get-var names[i]> found">
	     <set-var foo[i] = "<get-var names[i]> lost">>
