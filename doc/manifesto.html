    <b>Abstract:</b>
    <p>      Although World Wide Web use of the Internet has been growing at a
phenomenal rate over the past 3 years, there remains a dearth of
interesting and useful client/server applications.  Traditional
programming languages do not provide an optimal environment for
programming such applications because of the syntactical and
paradigmatic distance between traditional languages and the target
output, namely <b>HTML</b>.<p>The stateless and dynamic nature of the WWW requires a level of
support from traditional programming languages for which they are hard
pressed to provide.  Must each application programmer write his or her
own tool set to accomplish goals which are fundamentally similar
across applications?<p>This paper presents an alternative language choice for the design
and implementation of Web applications called <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup>, and
describes the three methods of delivery that have been completed.
Requirements, desirable features, and implementation considerations
are presented.  Finally, future directions of the language and
implementation are discussed.

         <font size="+2">H</font>ere is the classic Unix programming example.  How easy is it to write
a program that produces "Hello World!" as the user-viewable output?
Here is the <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> version:<p><pre>  Hello World!</pre><p><font size="+2">T</font>raditional programming languages attempt to solve the general problem
of expressing algorithms in a way which can be efficiently
implemented on a generic set of hardware.  Scripting languages attempt
to hide the details of the underlying hardware (and often software)
implementation by providing high-level ``primitives'' which can be used
to provide functionality in an atomic fashion.<p><font size="+2">L</font>ooked at in this light, one may consider the Hypertext Markup
Language (<b>HTML</b>) as a weak scripting language meant to be
executed on a generic piece of hardware called a <i>browser</i>.  It
contains high-level primitives for controlling the output (e.g.,
<code> &lt;P ALIGN=RIGHT&gt; ... &lt;/P&gt;</code>), and for receiving
input from the user (e.g., <code>&lt;INPUT TYPE=TEXT
...&gt;</code>). Yet, unlike a true scripting language, <b>HTML</b> is
missing variables, iteration, data structures and other general
programming constructs.<p><font size="+2">B</font>ecause the capabilities of the underlying hardware (i.e., the
browser) are extremely limited, writing even simple Web applications
requires the server side of the connection to do genuine computational
work.  This includes processing input, keeping track of state, and
decision making based on that data, resulting in an output view for
the client.<p><font size="+2">T</font>he necessity of allowing the programmer to dynamically change the
client's output view based upon client data was realized early on in
the development of the Web, and a general mechanism called the Common
Gateway Interface (<b>CGI</b>) was designed.<p><font size="+2">H</font>owever, the implementation languages available for use in CGI programs
have been limited to the world of general programming languages.  Compiled
languages such as C and Pascal, and interpreted languages such as Perl
and TCL have proven themselves as less than optimal languages for the
implementation of easily maintainable Web applications through the
length of time that it takes to create an application, and the length
of time it takes a programmer who is new to the existing application
code to ``get up to speed''.

      <font size="+2">T</font>he overview of the process of programming a Web application is
identical to traditional application programming: the application
displays some information which the user may interact with, the
choices that the user makes are examined by the application code, new

      <font size="+2">O</font>ne of the primary goals driving the creation of <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> was to
ease the writing and maintenance of programs which produce HTML as
their primary output format.  Since the output of Web programs is
HTML, and since that text is already considered a ``language'' in the
sense of browser execution, it appeared that the best choice for a
syntax was one that would not conflict with HTML in any way, and which
could be interspersed with HTML statements.<p><font size="+2">T</font>he syntax of <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> is the syntax of HTML.  The HTML
syntax model is quite simple; language statements may only
appear within matched less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;)
symbols, the keyword must appear directly after the less-than
character without intervening spaces, and the keyword must be on a
list which the browser supports.  If the keyword is not one which the
browser understands, the open angle-bracket, containing text, and
close angle-bracket are ignored.  All other text is treated as
straight text to be displayed.<p><font size="+2">T</font>he model used in <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> is identical.  However, the language
interpreter does not recognize any HTML keywords, and thus passes them
on to the browser to be executed.<p><font size="+2">A</font> short example is in order:<p><pre>  &lt;body &lt;get-var body-spec&gt;&gt;</pre><p><font size="+2">I</font>n the above example, the text <code>&lt;get-var body-spec&gt;</code> is a <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> language statement which retrieves the
value stored in the logical name <code>body-spec</code>.  If that
variable has a value, the value replaces the entire language
statement.  If that variable has no value, then the empty string
replaces the entire language statement.  The text <code>&lt;body ...&gt;</code> is an HTML statement, and is ignored by the
<FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> language interpreter.  Thus, the resultant text sent to
the browser is either:<p><pre>  &lt;body &gt;</pre><p><font size="+0">if</font> the variable <code>body-spec</code> has no
value, or<p><pre>  &lt;body bgcolor="ffffff"&gt;</pre><p><font size="+0">if</font> the variable <code>body-spec</code> has the

      <font size="+2">I</font>n a traditional environment, it is a trivial task for the application
code to store and recall the history of choices that the user has made
during the course of the interaction.  By contrast, the Web environment is
stateless; each time the user interacts with the output view causes a
single invocation of a program to run.  This means that the program
may not use traditional means<a name="footback-1"></a>(<a href="#footnote-1">1</a>)
to store and recall user interaction history; the information is
essentially lost for each separate invocation of the program.<p><font size="+2">I</font>f we do not require a change to the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol
(<b>HTTP</b>), exactly one solution exists for the problem of storing
and recalling  user input history across a stateless connection:  the
client <i>must</i> pass state information back to the server for each
interaction.<p><font size="+2">I</font>f all of the interaction history must be kept, and is passed back and
forth between the browser and the server, the growth of this
information becomes problematic.  Existing Web servers often have
static limits on the amount of information which can be passed in an
Universal Resource Locater (<b>URL</b>), and existing browsers also
have static limits on the amount of information that can be
represented in an URL.<p><font size="+2">O</font>ne solution addressing this problem is to represent large amounts of
information with a single (smaller) piece of information, called a
<i>token</i>.  Such tokens can be generated by the server when the
user first connects, and can be passed back and forth by browser and
server.  When the user submits some information, the new information
is saved away in less ephemeral storage, using the token as a key
under which the data may be found.  Previously submitted information
can be retrieved from the storage in the same fashion.<p><font size="+2">T</font>he method used to pass the token can be to encode the token as part
of the URL that the user sees, or, when allowable, to utilize a
feature of some browsers (e.g., Netscape) which allows the embedding
of token information in the surrounding HTTP.<p><font size="+2">N</font>ote that the token should be a sufficiently random set of bits that it
is difficult to derive from any other information, such as the time of
day, the hostname of the server machine, etc.  Since the token represents
the input history of a particular user, (essentially identifying that
user uniquely to the server), it is conceivable that another user
could masquerade as the owner of a token.  Solutions for this problem
include the prevention of network sniffing through the use of strong
encryption<a name="footback-2"></a>(<a href="#footnote-2">2</a>) and
continued randomization of the token information that is passed back
and forth.  Such solutions are not discussed in detail here.

  <hr width=30% align=left>
      <font size="+2">R</font>eal-world applications often rely on databases to interpret input, to
deliver output, or as the basis for the application itself.
Currently, writing a Web application which requires such databases
requires the programmer to either create the entire data storage and
retrieval mechanism from scratch, or purchase an off-the-shelf system,
learn the programmatic interface to that system, and then implement a
useful abstraction to that interface for the purposes of the application.<p><font size="+2">N</font>aturally, this situation is less than ideal.  Programs written this
way are generally strongly tied to a specific database product, which,
in turn, can limit the hardware platforms available to run the
application, limit the functionality of the application, and/or limit
the future of the application (e.g., a necessary database feature
might be missing).<p><FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> addresses this issue by providing a small set of database
manipulation primitives, thus making a clean abstraction to the
underlying database engine.  A variety of different database engine
products can be linked into the language interpreter, so engines with
ISAM capabilities, SQL parsers, and the like may be utilized.  In
fact, the programmer may easily switch between different database
engines in the course of a single program, thereby maximizing the
benefits of each.<p><font size="+2">T</font>he abstraction provides database creation, file locking,
record-locking, key storage and lookup, and generic query operations
as part of the basic functionality.  Additional features of a specific
database engine model can be utilized by means of a single primitive.

low-level access to the internal operations of the language engine, so
that programs which used the library could have maximum control over

well-defined, the implementation of any particular task was a
quick and straight-forward process.  Separate libraries for symbol
manipulation, textual buffer manipulation, textual translations,
memory management, database control functions, and session tracking
and manipulation were written and tested individually, and then linked
together with a language parser, implementing the complete command set

server, the model of running a subset of pages, or even every page at

installation of the language interpreter as a CGI program which will
handle those pages.<p><font size="+2">T</font>he CGI interpreter takes its information from the calling
environment<a name="footback-4"></a>(<a href="#footnote-4">4</a>)

document (a file of <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> code which is interpreted before the
target), various translations on the URL which was supplied, and the
definition of a set of variables describing the environment and
various aspects of the target file (i.e., the physical location of the

separate program to process <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> documents.  This is a genuine
Web server, with the same features that appear in other popular
servers, such as configurable logging for accesses, errors, referer
pointers, user agents, and debugging, support for ``server-push'',
logical to physical mapping of URLs, fine and large grained control
over CGI execution, and support for random MIME types.  Additional
features include Netscape compatible secure connections, server
corrected headers and performance logging.<p><font size="+2">O</font>ne obvious benefit of the server model is the ability for the user to
write <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> code which can be executed in the server
environment, effectively creating a user-level programmable server.
For example, a <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> function can be defined which will be
called after the client request is read, but before the request is
acted upon.  Based on information found in the client request, the
called function may change aspects of the request, perform
calculations and/or logging functions, or any other operation which is
of interest to the programmer (e.g., one could send mail whenever a
specific host accesses a specific URL).<p><font size="+2">C</font>onfiguration of the server is done by writing <FONT SIZE="+0">M</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ETA</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">-</FONT><FONT SIZE="+0">HTML</FONT><sup><font size="-2">tm</font></sup> statements
in a configuration file.  This gives the user the power of a genuine
programming language, and allows maximum flexibility.<p><font size="+2">T</font>arget files written for this model are transferrable without
