		       Meta-HTML 6.11 Release

Version 6.11 of the Meta-HTML Web Language distribution is now
available for download from:

	ftp://ftp.metahtml.com/pub/GNU/metahtml-6.11.tar.gz

It should be available from ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/metahtml, and GNU
mirror sites (see http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html) within the
next two weeks.

			     What is it?

Meta-HTML is a programming language specifically designed for working
within the World Wide Web environment.  Although it is a genuine
programming language, suitable for large-scale symbolic manipulation,
it provides the most commonly wanted Web functionality as built-in
primitives, so you don't have to write them.  You can find out more
about the theory of implementation in this white paper
[http://www.metahtml.org/documentation/manifesto.html].

Web pages are authored using HTML and Meta-HTML statements freely
intermixed.  When a page is requested by a browser, the page is passed
through the Meta-HTML interpreter, which dynamically processes any
Meta-HTML statements to produce a final HTML page that is delivered
to the browser.

The source distribution provides several different interpreter options:

	* A CGI engine which can be run by any Unix Web server,
	* A FastCGI engine which can be run under FastCGI compliant servers,
	* A full-featured Web server (mhttpd) with the interpreter built in,
	* A standalone processor, much like Perl or Tcl, and
	* An interactive debugger, with a feel similar to GDB (mdb)

Release 6.11 marks the first release of Meta-HTML with an integrated
byte compiler, which (although buggy) can bring a 50 to 500 times
speedup to the execution of your Meta-HTML code.

Also new in 6.11 is an ODBC based PostGres module called modpodbc,
which can be used to talk directly to a PostGres database.  You load
this module with <sql::set-database-type PODBC> -- please see the
documentation for more details.

We are ready to start aggressively maintaining Meta-HTML at this time,
so please report all bugs as you find them!
