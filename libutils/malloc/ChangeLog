 	table.

	(morecore_recursing): New static variable.
	(morecore): If that is set, return null immediately.
	When growing the info table, before getting new core from the
 	system for it, set morecore_recursing and try moving _heapinfo
 	with _realloc_internal.  When that fails and we get new core, set
 	_heaplimit to cover the core for the new _heapinfo table.
	(register_heapinfo): New function.  Record the _heapinfo table's
	own blocks in that table and in the statistics variables.
	(initialize, _malloc_internal): Use it after allocating new table.

 	iteration use the initial portion of it.
	* malloc/free.c (_free_internal): Account for twice
 	__malloc_extra_blocks in deciding if we have so much extra memory
 	we should return it to the system.
	* malloc/malloc.h (__malloc_extra_blocks): Declare it.
	* posix/glob.c (prefix_array, glob_pattern_p): Remove gratuitous
 	const in parameter decl.

Sun Jan 22 15:19:51 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>
