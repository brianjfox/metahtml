  <h3> Reap Timed Out Sessions </h3>
  <ptext>
    <synopsis reap-sessions [-f session-db]>

    <code>reap-sessions</code> causes all timed-out entries in the session
    database to be deleted.  It is not normally necessary to call this
    command directly, since each time a new session is created, the
    session database is examined for timed-out sessions, and any found are
    removed.

    However, while debugging your new <meta-html> application, you may
    find it useful to call this command line version.

    If you are utilizing a session database which is not stored in the
    usual location (<code>/tmp/sessions.db</code>), you may give the
    <code>-f <i>FILENAME</i></code> argument, where
    <code><i>FILENAME</i></code> is the path to the file containing the
    session database.
