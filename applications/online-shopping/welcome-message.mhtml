  Welcome to the world of <small-caps><b>Online-Shopping</b></small-caps>!

  This application presents a catalog of products, and allows a consumer
  to peruse information about the products, place specific products
  into a <b>shopping cart</b>, and ultimately, purchase the items
  that have been selected.
  
  During this process, the consumer may see the total cost of the
  products selected so far, the amount of tax that might be charged,
  and the contents of his or her shopping cart.

  When the shopping cart is filled to the satisfaction of the consumer,
  the contents of the cart may be purchased immediately, saved away
  under a username/password pair for later purchase, or discarded.

  Thus, this application provides the consumer with a stress-free
  shopping environment in which various ``what-if'' possibilities can be
  explored, and provides the merchant with an interactive sales tool
  which doesn't require human intervention.
