<ptext>
The <meta-html> Engine is the CGI program which actually interprets
<meta-html> statements in your documents.

The Engine gets the path of the page to process from the environment
variable <var PATH_INFO>, which is also where it tries to find the
value of the current session ID.  Thus, a full URL to a page full of
<meta-html> commands stored in your Web documents directory as
<code>"foo/bar.mhtml"</code> might look like:

<example>
  http://www.your-site.com/cgi-bin/nph-engine/foo/bar.mhtml
</example>

and, if a session ID were present in the URL,

<example>
  http://www.your-site.com/cgi-bin/nph-engine/73847837482/foo/bar.mhtml
</example>

Obviously, this URL is "ugly" in the sense that it is unlikely people
browsing your Web site could remember it, or that it is something you
would like to publish in a television commercial.  So, the goal is to
make some reasonable URL, such as
<code>http://www.your-site.com/foo/bar.mhtml</code> be the one that
your viewers see.

You handle this translation in the configuration files for your
server, and the <a href="serverconf.mhtml">server specific
sections</a> of this manual tell you how to do that for many of the
popular servers.

For example, let's say that you are building a hairy site for an
organization called "Foo Industries."  The URL of Foo Industries is
<code>http://www.foo.com</code>.  The Web administrator for Foo
Industries sets up a translation for  <code>"/*"</code> to point to
<code>"/cgi-bin/mhtml-engine/*"</code>.

An URL such as "http://www.foo.com/index.html" causes the Engine to be
run, with a <var PATH_INFO> value of <code>"/index.html."</code>  The
engine reads in and interprets "index.html", and then returns that page.

The <meta-html> Engine performs various translation on the path that
it receives; in effect, it is a small and powerful server on its own.

Prior to executing any page, the file <code>"engine.conf"</code> is
executed.  Typically, this file is used to set up any globally known
page variables, so that references to, for example, <var SITE-DIRECTORY>
can be resolved readily within the document pages.
